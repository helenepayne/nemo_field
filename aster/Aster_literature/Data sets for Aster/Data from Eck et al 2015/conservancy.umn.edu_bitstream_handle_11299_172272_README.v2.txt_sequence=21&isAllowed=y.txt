The "techreport.v2.Rnw" document can be compiled in R (requires knitr and aster2 packages):

In R, type:

        require(knitr) || install.packages("knitr")
        require(aster2) || install.packages("aster2")

        setwd([set to location of .Rnw file])

and then compile:

        library(knitr)
        knit("techreport.v2.Rnw")

Or type the following outside of R (in unix, e. g., linux or Mac OS X):

        Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('techreport.v2.Rnw')"

Once the .Rnw file is compiled and saved as a .tex file in the working directory, type the following outside R (in unix, e. g., linux or Mac OS X: need to be in the same location as directory above). This requires MacTeX for MacOSX, and proTeXt for Windows:

        pdflatex techreport.v2.tex
        pdflatex techreport.v2.tex

(may need to repeat the "pdflatex" command several times). This will result in the "tech report.v2.pdf" file.
