The folder named "SAS.outputs" contains the codes and outputs from our analyses:


--- "ANALYSES_FULLDATASET.pdf" contains the SAS output of all the mixed-models implemented to analyze the fitness estimates in L. fremontii (data set "Fitness_Lfremontii.xls")


--- "BLUPSmixedmodelG.pdf" contains our estimates of the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUPs) for each PHS family from the model that allowed sire variances to differ for all Hydroperiod x Population combinations


--- "NumberViableSeedsCorrelation.pdf" contains results from the ANCOVA testing if inflorescence weight predicts the number of viable seeds per individual (fitness), and if this relationship was consistent among populations


--- SAScode.sas contains the code of the all the mixed-models implemented to analyze the fitness estimates in L. fremontii. To run this code please use the file "Fitness_Lfremontii.xls" stored in the folder "Data" (see below)


The folder named "Data" contains all of our original fitness estimates used in our SAS.code as well as the precipitation data to build our hydrological models

--- "Fitness_Lfremontii.xls" contains our fitness estimates for each population under the three different hydroperiod treatments

--- "Monthly&AnnualPrepbyYear_PRISMdata" contains historic records of precipitation at each of the three locations used in our experiment (see R.code in supplemental materials)

--- "PrecipDataForHydroperiodEstimates_CIMIS.xls" contains the precipitation and evapotranspiration data obtained from CIMIS to build our hydroperiod treatments
